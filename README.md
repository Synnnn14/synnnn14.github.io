## Syn's File Server
### About this repo:
This is my file storage solution! You see, you need to pay to upload certain files to Neocities. I don't have enough money kicking around for that. I will probably never use the amount of space GitHub generously provides people with for free, so I'd be happy to host other people's files to save them from the trouble of configuring their own repository.
### If you'd like something hosted:
I can be contacted on Discord using the tag **Synaesthesia#4200**. You can just ask for some storage space.
I will have a few questions, but as long as I see no issue, I will give you a dedicated folder!
If I believe you are particularly trustworthy, I will let you upload and delete files on this repo yourself. Do not touch the files of others.
### Neociites cheat sheet:
There are certain files that Neocities won't let you host without paying. Two good examples of this are cursor files and audio files.
Audio files can be hosted here and linked to directly.
Cursor files are a bit more tricky. GitHub pages doesn't let you hotlink to them.
Click on your cursor file, right click on the download button, then copy the link. You can link to this with CSS and it will work normally.
#### I hope you are having a nice day/night.
#### Yours truly, Synaesthesia.
